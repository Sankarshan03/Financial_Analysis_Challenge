# Financial_Analysis_Challenge

This analyst challenge was a flagship event of Citibank, that is conducted every year for the students doing internship there. It was a 4-week challenge where we conducted thorough research across various research papers and discussion came upon the Stock analysis topic. Through this project, we were able to explore various python libraries like Scikit, Seaborn, ttest_ind, LogisticRegression, etc. to provide huge insights and analysis of our data.

We imported the datasets from yfinance and US GDP data from the official website for the span of 5 years obtained on daily and quarterly basis respectively. Initially deployed the EDA to process a clean dataset then derived few other properties from the datasets for example the melted table, pivot table, mean closing prices across month in year. 

Applied Logistic regression model and achieved an accuracy of 60% on buying and selling indicators over time. Prepared a story using tableau dashboard depicting various datasets and its relationship through joining of datasets like GDP and stock closing prices.

Provided insights on momentum hypothesis through short-term momentum effects by dividing the momentum portfolios depending on their ranks and proved the hypothesis as true and also proved the correlation hypothesis obtained on scatter plot of GDP and Apple stock closing values as positive due to its linearly increasing trend.
